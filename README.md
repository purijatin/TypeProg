# TypeProg

To run akka-streams twitter example:
  * Download sbt from here: http://www.scala-sbt.org/
  * Set your environment variable to sbt/bin
This is how it looks like on my comp:
export SBT=/home/jatin/work/awesome/sbt/sbt/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$SBT
  * Clone this repo. Goto this folder on command line
  * Do: sbt run
  * It will provide a list of all files containing `main` method. Enter 10. (i.e. corresponding to: reactives.akka.twitter.Main)
